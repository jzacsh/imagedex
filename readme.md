Purpose:
  Keep a JSON index of your images and only re-index what's needed, when
  needed, on inotify's queue.

Use:
  I intend to run this script as a response to inotify events; only generating
  a .json file when something in the target has supposedly changed.

Warning:
  This is an experimental project for the sake of learning. If you have an
  application aiming for high concurrency, you probably should not do things
  like this ... but then, you probably already know that ;).
Note:
  All code here is written with sync operations.

TODO:
- convert all calls to sync calls
- basic slideshow js front-end.
